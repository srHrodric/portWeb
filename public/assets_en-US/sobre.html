        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Hello! I'm Rodrigo Santos, a developer with more than two years of experience in the industry and in freelance work. My professional career started with PHP, and, over time, I focused on improving my skills in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>Node.js</b>, fundamental technologies for modern web development.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          During my career, I have had the opportunity to lead and contribute to several projects, including:
          <ul>
            <li>API development;</li>
            <li>Integrations with ERP services;</li>
            <li>Creation of Landing Pages;</li>
            <li>Development and implementation of multiplatform web systems.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          In many of these projects, I acted as the main developer, being responsible for the complete logic of the applications, from the Front-end to the Back-end, using JavaScript and Node.js efficiently. My experience ranges from solving challenging technical problems to designing scalable and well-structured solutions.
        </p>
          
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Currently, I am dedicated to the creation of projects aimed at use on the web, focusing on compatibility between different devices. I am responsible for both the visual interface and the logic of systems, developing robust Back-end structures and integrating them with APIs of various services. My goal is to deliver complete, functional and scalable solutions, aligned with customer needs and market demands.
